# Molecular Solubility Prediction

A project to predict and interpret the aqueous solubility of small molecules using molecular descriptors as a tool for lead optimization.

## Project Structure

- **`Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`** - Notebook for data loading, cleaning, and feature extraction using RDKit.
- **`Model_Training.ipynb`** - Notebook for training machine learning models using scikit-learn.
- **`Model_Interpretation.ipynb`** - Notebook for final model evaluation and prediction interpretation.

## Project Overview

This project aims to:
- Extract meaningful molecular descriptors from SMILES strings.
- Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict aqueous solubility.
- Provide an interpretation of molecular feature contributions to aqueous solubility predictions.
